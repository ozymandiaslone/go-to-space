# go-to-space
This project has been unfortunately deprecated due to the prohibitive new API pricing model Twitter (X) has implemented. 

## Function
This was a twitter bot - https://twitter.com/Space_Pics_Bot - 
The bot performed exactly as I intended.

## Surprising occurence
This bot used to tweet once an hour, every hour of the day, for a very long time. Months and months. A while into this process, I noticed that I was gaining followers. The catch is, I'm nearly 100% certain these followers are mostly bots.
I don't know the exact mechanic behind this, but a part of me wants to belive that I accidentally uncovered some sort of Twitter user retention function. My theory is as follows: The Twitter algorithm saw that this account was a 'regular' user
in the sense that it very frequently posted content to Twitter. And I suspect that they may have generated a false following in order to keep the presumed human behind this account active on twitter. An interesting cavieat is that most posts made by
this account still receive little to no engagement - from either actual humans or bots. 

### Moratorium
The influx of false followers very slowly petered out after the account stopped making posts. Whenever I go on the account manually to make a post or engage with a tweet, however, an influx of bot followers floods in again. I really don't know what exactly is going on, but I suppose it is interesting at the very least.
